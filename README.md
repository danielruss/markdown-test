# Getting Started with Markdown
This is my first attempt to use markdown.  Hopefully, it (markdown) will be easy to use.  If so, maybe I can create simple vignettes that show how to use various code that I write. I think I will start off with simple stuff like lists, tables, and figures.
### Lists are the easiest.
Lets try a simple list.  **Note:** *I used a **tab** to indent the sub lists, and a __shift-tab__ to return to the main list*.
* Item 1
  * Item 1a
  * Item 1b
* Item 2
  * Item 2a
  * Item 2b
* Item 3

1. An Item
1. Another Item
   1. Indented Item (hmmm...  it apprears to need 3 spaces)
   1. Another Indented Item
2. A third Item

### Table are a little more complicated. 
This uses git flavored markdown.  So, it may not work everywhere.
~~hmm having trouble~~ -- ok really just trying to strikethrough the text.

col 1 header|col 2 header|col 3 header
------------|------------|------------
1 | 2 | 3
The rain in Spain | stays mainly | on the plains

The space around the "|" seem to be important.

### pictures
need to upload a picture

### code

    public int add(int x, int y){
        return x+y;
    }
